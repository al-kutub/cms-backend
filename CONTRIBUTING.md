## Contributing

Thank you for helping improve Quranic accessibility. This guide keeps contributions smooth, consistent, and aligned with our workflow.

## Branch Strategy
- **Protected branches**: `main`, `staging` (PRs only; no direct commits)
- **Active development**: `{feature_branch}` (direct commits allowed)
- **Flow**: `staging` (PR) → `main` (PR). Do not skip stages.
- **Features**: branch from `staging` as `feat/<short-description>`

## Workflow
1) Start from `staging` or a `feat/*` branch
2) Run `pre-commit install` if you have not already (one-time setup)
3) Make small, focused commits with clear messages
4) Test locally; fix linter/type errors
5) Push to `origin/staging` or open a PR from `feat/*` to `staging`
6) Request review; address feedback; keep PRs concise

**All PRs must pass linting checks to be merged.** Pre-commit hooks run automatically on each commit to catch issues early.

## Development Setup
- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management (`uv sync` to install)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for linting hooks (`pre-commit install` to activate)
- Docker (recommended) or native setup
- See `README.md` -> Quick Start

## Testing

### Running tests

Use `pytest` (not `manage.py test`). From the project root with the dev virtualenv active:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage (same as CI)
uv run pytest

# Run a single app's tests (faster feedback)
uv run pytest apps/content/tests/

# Skip coverage for a quick local run
uv run pytest --no-cov
```

### Framework

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pytest-django` | Django test runner integration |
| `pytest-cov` | Coverage measurement (sources: `apps/`) |
| `model-bakery` | Model factories for test data |
| `moto` | AWS/S3 mock for R2 storage tests |
| `freezegun` | Time-freezing for date-sensitive tests |
| `responses` | HTTP request mocking |

Configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` and `[tool.coverage.*]`.

### Coverage

Every `pytest` run prints a terminal coverage report (missing lines highlighted). In CI, a `coverage.xml` artifact is uploaded to the GitHub Actions run for each PR.

Coverage is measured over `apps/` and excludes migrations and test files themselves.

### Test layout

Tests live alongside each Django app under `apps/<app>/tests/`, mirroring the module they cover:

```
apps/
  content/
    tests/
      public/          ← tests for the Public API surface
      portal/          ← tests for the Portal API surface
      tenant/          ← tests for the Tenant API surface
      test_*.py        ← model / service tests
  users/tests/
  publishers/tests/
  ...
```

### Standards

- Follow Arrange–Act–Assert (AAA)
- Name tests: `test_<function_name>_where<criteria>_should<expected_results>`
- Every new feature or bug fix requires a corresponding test
- A failing test blocks the CI pipeline — PRs cannot merge with a red test suite

## API & Errors
- APIs: Django Ninja; document responses
- 400s: `apps.core.ninja_utils.errors.ItqanError`
- 403s: `rest_framework.exceptions.PermissionDenied`
- Document errors with `NinjaErrorResponse` when applicable

## Style & Quality
- Python 3.13, Django 5.2 compatible
- Type hint all functions
- Prefer `AwareDateTime` in Schemas
- Avoid unnecessary try/except; keep control flow clear
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check linting before pushing

## CI/CD & Deployment
- GitHub Actions enforce branch flow and protections
- Deployments run only on successful PR merges to protected branches

## Licensing

## Getting Help & Contact
- **GitHub Issues**: Technical issues and bugs (include context, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior)
- **Discussions**: General questions and ideas
- **Discord**: https://discord.gg/24CskUbuuB
- **Email**: connect@itqan.dev

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful and constructive. Assume positive intent. Report unacceptable behavior to maintainers.

## Recognition
We deeply appreciate every contributor—maintainers, reviewers, issue reporters, testers, translators, and Quranic data publishers.

- Individuals and organizations are welcome to contribute
- Significant contributions will be highlighted in release notes
- All contributors will be acknowledged on the GitHub contributors page

## Important For AI/LLM Users
This is an open-source project that aim to help the muslim community and provide a way to distribute Quranic content through safe verified channels.
I want to emphasize that we need to foster a community that will continue to contribute to this project in the future as well as now.
AI is welcomed, however the contributor needs to be aware of the project goals and try to adhere to the best coding standards.
## Most Importantly: YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR CODE DOES AND TEST IT**
Many hours have been wasted on trying to test and verify code that their owners didn't read or test themselves, and it is affecting all the maintainers negatively.
We all have access to AI and LLMs, if you are a just a middleman between The maintainer and the AI, then I hate to tell you that you are not benefiting this project, you are harming it.
Jazakum Allahu khairan for advancing Quranic accessibility!
